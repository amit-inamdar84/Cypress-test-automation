Cypress quick course notes:
Go to the project directory and execute git clone "URL of repo"
npm install to install dependencies mentioned in package.json
npm start - This will start the application
Open new command prompt
npx cypress open to open cypress test runner.


describe.only will execute only this suite
it.only will execute only this spec.
Hooks - before (will run once before any tests) and beforeEach (will run once before every test)
beforeEach can be inserted inside describe. Then it will run once before each test that are inside that describe.

Notes from next tutor: https://cognizant.udemy.com/course/automated-testing-with-cypress/learn/lecture/18040081?start=15#overview
Advantages:
Smart automatic waiting
Good documentation
Video recording
Real time reloads

How is it different?
Different from Selenium architecture
Works on network layer
Controls all aspects of automation from browser - Any manipulation can be done.

Limitations:
Only Javascript
Limited cross browser testing (Supports Chrome, Edge, Electron, Firefox)
Controls one browser at a time
Controls ony one tab of a browser

Installation and setup:
Create a new project root folder
Open terminal and execute npm init - This will create package.json file
Enter package.json details in command prompt.
Package.json file will be created.
In terminal install cypress using the command: npm install cypress

Prettier setup: (prettier.io)
npm install prettier
Create a new file under root folder - .prettierrc
{
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "useTabs": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "arrowParens": "avoid",
  "trailingComma": "es5"
}
This file will define coding standards.

Intelligent code completion:
Run npx cypress open to open cypress test runner.
Just close the runner and in editor the cypress folder structure will be created. It includes cypress.json file and cypress folder.
Create new file under cypress folder and name it tsconfig.json
Paste the following code in the file and restart the editor.
{
    "compilerOptions": {
      "allowJs": true,
      "baseUrl": "../node_modules",
      "types": [
        "cypress"
      ]
    },
    "include": [
      "**/*.*"
    ]
  }
  
Add these two commands in package.json:
   "cy:open": "cypress open",
    "cy:run" : "cypress run"

Cypress folders purpose:
fixtures: To store test data.
integration: To write test scripts
plugins: To define external plugins
support: index.js file runs before every spec.
command.js file is used to define custom commands.

Running cypress test in browser:
As defined in package.json run the command npm run cy:open which invokes cypress open
In cypress test runner, click on required test case to run in selected browser.

Running cypress test in headless mode:
As defined in package.json run the command npm run cy:run which invokes cypress run. This will run all specs
To run selected spec use: npx cypress run --spec ./cypress/integration/18-headless-mode/start.js


cy.visit - has two parameters - string for URL and options for timeout.
For further notes please refer editor. Start with the file simple.js

Xpaths in cypress:
Xpath are not required in Cypress as native selectors are available. But still if we need xpath need to install the following plugin.
npm install cypress-xpath
Open support\index.js file and insert the code - require('cypress-xpath');

Cypress $ function:
const element = Cypress.$('#sign_in');
element.click();
 
Tip:
cy.url().should('include', 'Test') - include can be used with url or title.
cy.get('#testid').should('contain', 'Text') - Here instead of include contain should be used. If we use include will get below error:
Timed out retrying after 4000ms: object tested must be an array, a map, an object, a set, a string, or a weakset, but object given


Visual testing is the automated process of detecting and reviewing visual UI changes.
Visual testing captures snapshot of screens under test. This is called base image/snapshot. Next time when we run the same test case and if there is any change in the snapshot
either pixel wise or resolution wise or any minute part of image, the test will fail.
This is also useful to capture image of web table and test it for any changes in records during regression. Looks like this is only for static data. Need to check.

For visual regression testing need to install the following dependency.
npm install cypress-image-snapshot
And also add below code to index.js file under plugins folder.
 const { addMatchImageSnapshotPlugin } = require("cypress-image-snapshot/plugin");
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  addMatchImageSnapshotPlugin(on, config);
}
Also add below code to commands.js file under the folder support:
import{ addMatchImageSnapshotCommand } from "cypress-image-snapshot/command"

addMatchImageSnapshotCommand({
    failureTreshold: 0.0,
    failureTresholdType: "percent",
    customDiffConfig: { treshold: 0.0},
    capture: "viewport"
})

Cypress.Commands.add('setResolution', size => {
    if(Cypress._.isArray(size)) {
        cy.viewport(size[0],size[1]);
    }
    else{
        cy.viewport(size);
    }
})

To update base snapshots add the below code in package.json
"cy:update-snapshots": "cypress run --env updateSnapshots=true"
For single test case: npx cypress run --spec ./cypress/integration/visualregression/image.js --env updateSnapshots=true

Date and time override feature should be used if application contains date and time.

Images for a test case are not matching between headless run and browser run. Need to find solution for this.

Disabling failing tests:
For debugging purposes, if we want to mark image comparison failure as pass, we can use below script in package.json.
"cy:run-tests-with-no-failure": "cypress run --env failOnSnapshotDiff=false";

Overriding matchImageSnapshot:
If we need to change threshold value for testing purposes, we can call the function with object as an argument:
cy.get('h1').matchImageSnapshot({
 failureTreshold: 10.0,
 failureTresholdType: "pixels"
});


Percy:
Integration: Create an account in percy website.
Login and create a new project.
Copy the project token and run the command in your terminal in project root folder:
$env:PERCY_TOKEN = "ff032b66771be296164b2ff26953286fb51935d3c66bcdbd08977304198c4b72"
Open package.json
In the terminal install percy and percy CLI using command: 
npm install @percy/cypress
npm install @percy/cli
The percy dependency - @percy/cypress and @percy/cli, should display in package.json
Add import '@percy/cypress' to index.js file under support folder. This will provide access to percy snapshot command.
In the test case use cy.percySnapshot() method to send snapshots to percy.
Run below command run to run all test cases:
percy exec -- cypress
For single spec use the command:
npx percy exec -- cypress run --spec ./cypress/integration/visualregression/percyVisualTest.js
Check for builds in percy app for image comparison.

Page objects pattern:
The idea of page objects patttern is create abstraction over test code, separate application sections into classes, selectors
and behaviour. If a selector changes the idea is to fxi it in a class and not everywhere in tests. This helps in easy maintenance
of tests.
Base page: This will contain code that all classes can use. For ex: wait, pause.

Cucumber BDD:
npm install cypress-cucumber-preprocessor
In cypress.json file add this configuration - 
"ignoreTestFiles":["*.js", "*.md"],
"testFiles": "**/*.feature"

In cypress/plugins/index.js file, add the below code:
const cucumber = require('cypress-cucumber-preprocessor').default

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('file:preprocessor', cucumber())
}

Cucumber has 3 files: Feature file, Step definition file and Page object
We can pass parameters in feature file and accept them as arguments in step definition files.
@focus tag on a scenario will make only the marked scenario to run.

Shared step definition (Kind of test base file in Selenium):
Create a folder common and common.js file under it.
Import below statement:
import { defineStep } from 'cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/steps';
The keyword like Given, When, Then are actually part of defineStep keyword.
No write commonly used functions in defineStep section.
Write scenario in feature file which should be same as defined in step definition file. Run feature file.

Continuous integration:
It is the process of automatically detecting, pulling, building and automated testing as source code is changed for a product.
CI is the activity that starts pipeline.
Continuous delivery refers to the overall chain of processes that automatically gets source code changes and runs them
through build, test, packaging and related operations to produce a deployable release, largely without human intervention.

Cypress dashboard:
Free plans provides support for 3 users and 500 test results.
Dashboard shows test runs and their results with screenshots, videos, failures etc.

Running scripts through Jenkins:
Start tomcat server and open Jenkins
Create project and configure. 
Use custom workspace and provide project path.
Add build step as execute windows command and specify the command you want to run from Jenkins.
Click Save and apply.
Now the cypress tests can be run from Jenkins.

Parameterized builds in Jenkins:
In project configure section click - This project is parameterized
Add a choice parameter and name it - script
Add choices as:
cy:run:chrome
cy:run:firefox
cy:run:electron
In build step section enter the command npm run "$script"
Now build the project with parameters.
You will see options to run as 
cy:run:chrome
cy:run:firefox
cy:run:electron
Select the required one and run the build.

Run jenkins war in cypress:
Define a script in package.json:
"start-jenkins-server":"java -jar D:/Tomcat Server/apache-tomcat-8.5.33-windows-x64/apache-tomcat-8.5.33/webapps/jenkins.war -httpPort=8080 --enable-future-java"
And in powershell execute:
npm run start-jenkins-server
Note: If jenkins.war is installed under cypress root folder path need not be specified. Just do:
"start-jenkins-server":"java -jar jenkins.war -httpPort=8080 --enable-future-java"

Docker:
Download docker for desktop
Install docker plugin in visual studio code.
Create Dockerfile under the root folder of your project.
In this file write the following code:
FROM cypress/base:12.19.0
RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN npm install
RUN $(npm bin)/cypress verify
RUN ["npm", "run", "cy:run"]

The above code mentions node version, creates a directory app, makes it working directory, copies all source code into that app directory, installs all dependencies mentioned in
package.json, verifies the installation and run the scripts/commands mentioned in package.json.
All these actions happen inside the docker container.
Create .dockerignore file under root folder and add the code: node_modules
Now start docker engine.
Run the command docker build -t firstdockerbuild .
All actions mentioned in docker file will run in container.

Cypress dark theme:
In console use the command: npm install --save-dev cypress-dark
In index.js file under support, add require('cypress-dark')
In cypress.json include "theme": "dark"
Tests running in browser will not have a dark theme.

Failed logs JSON reporter:
When a test fails the error is logged to JSON file for debugging purposes.
In console use the command: npm install --save-dev cypress-failed-log
In index.js file under support, add require('cypress-failed-log')
Under plugins folder index.js file, add below code in module.exports:
on('task',{
  failed: require('cypress-failed-log/src/failed')
})
No runs test to fail. New folder called logs will generate and a json file under it will show the logs.

Best practice:
1. Use selectors that are resilient. Better to ask developers to add data-* attributes.
If not use ID's. Last preference is for xpath.
2. Do not store return values of locators and then perform action. As JS is asynchronous it will not work.
Ex: const abc = cy.get('something'); abc.click();
3. It is best not to test 3rd party sites. Just test website that you control.
4. Do not allow tests to rely on state on other tests. If required then write dependent code in before or beforeEach hooks.
Or combine multiple tests into one larger test.
5. Do not write tiny tests with each tests containing one line of code and one assertion. They look like unit tests. E2E tests
usually have multiple assertions validating multiple elemenents.
6. Instead of after or afterEach hook use before or beforeEach hooks to clean the state. ie.DB connectt/reset, test data etc.
7. Do not put unnecessary waits. Cypress automatically waits in many cases.


Pending:
1. CypressError: `cy.then()` timed out after waiting `4000ms`.
Your callback function returned a promise that never resolved.
Spec: cypress\integration\visualregression\dataTable.js
2. To exclude .js files in test runner when running cucumber tests add the below code in cypress.json:
"ignoreTestFiles":["*.js", "*.md"]
3. Check example scripts from Cypress team when new cypress project is created. (cypress/integration/examples)
4. ///<reference types = "Cypress" /> - This will suggest cypress commands while typing.  
5. Alt+Shift+F for text formatting in visual studio code.
6. Data driven testing with Cypress and  organizing test data.
7. Best practices for page object pattern in cypress.
8. Using random test data in test scripts.
